\section{Introduction}
STP\cite{Vijay:Thesis:2007} is an efficient open source solver for QF\_BV and arrays without extensionality. STP
recursively simplifies bit-vector constraints, solves linear bit-vector equations, and then eagerly encodes them to CNF
for solving. Array axioms are added as needed during an abstraction-refinement phase.

Two versions of STPs are submitted to STMCOMP 2015. Both are  revision bff0edecbb7c08a of STP's publicly available source code
repository~\cite{STP:github}. The version with "-minisat-v15" uses MiniSat~\cite{MiniSat:github} revision
37dc6c67 set as default solver. The verison with "-cryptominisat4-v15" contains CryptoMiniSat4~\cite{CMS:github}
revision 24db9219b180 set as default solver.

\section{Development history}
STP was originally developed by Vijay Ganesh under the supervision of Professor David Dill. Later releases were
developed by Trevor Hansen under the supervision of Peter Schachte and Harald SÃ¸ndergaard. STP handles arbitrary
precision integers using Steffen Beyer's library. STP encodes into CNF via the and-inverter graph package ABC of Alan
Mishchenko~\cite{Brayton:2010:AAI:2144310.2144317}.

Since SMT-COMP 2015 we have made great progress at cleaning up the STP repository and have significantly
improved the underlying SAT solver, CryptoMiniSat4's performance. The STP repository now contains a large number of
automated testing, buliding and deployment scripts. Further, it contains a large test suite and more inner self-checks
through asserts. STP is being actively developed on \href{https://github.com/stp/stp}{GitHub}.
